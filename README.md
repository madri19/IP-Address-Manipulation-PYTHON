# IP-Address-Manipulation-PYTHON
I wrote this script to better manage changing the ip address and host name at an instant while working on a project that runs multiple raspberry pis. Every RPi is assigned a node number from a dip switch input and this script can set the last section of the ip address(192.168.1.XXX) accordingly so I can identify which pi it is on the network.
